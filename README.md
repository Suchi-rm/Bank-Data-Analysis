# Bank-Data-Analysis
Analysing a dataset of one-year customer data collected by a UK bank over the past year and classify on the available features. The features of the dataset are observed and analyzed according to the four levels. i.e., Descriptive Statistics, Inferential Statistics, Clustering method of Machine Learning and Deep Learning.
This analysis uses the data collected from the customer data of a bank in the UK, which includes information on customer ID, name, gender, age, job title and balance of the customer. The bank balance of the account and the age of customer is analysed using different methods. First, descriptive analysis is performed in order to understand the data, organize it and summarize it. Further analysis of statistical inference is done using correlation and scatter plots, to analyse and draw a general conclusion about the age and the balance of a bank account. In the section on machine learning, different methods of clustering are performed on two numerical columns, namely age and balance of the bank account. Under this section, K mean clustering and hierarchical clustering is performed on the data and the results of both of these methods are studied and compared. Regression model is applied on the data set for Deep Learning analysis.
